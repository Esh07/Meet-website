# A Reason for this website 
I have designed and developed a website for a professional photographer to showcase his work and attract potential clients. The website caters to individuals aged 19-60 who are interested in viewing his work and possibly hiring him.

# AA Navihation bar 
The website is fully responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes. It features a navigation bar with five clickable links that lead to different pages on the site. When the screen width is above 885px, the navigation button becomes invisible. Clicking on the menu button reveals a pop-up menu from which users can continue to navigate the site. To close the navigation menu, users can click on a close icon.

# AAA Home page
The "home" page welcomes visitors with a message and a background image of the photographer.

# AAA About page
The "About" page provides a brief background and experience of the photographer. It also includes tabs for "Skills," "Experience," and "Education," which offer users a summary of each.

# AAA Projects page
The "My Projects" page features a grid layout that showcases the photographer's work in video, camera, and drone photography. Each item includes a short description to provide users with a better understanding of the work. Hovering over each item highlights it and causes it to move up slightly.

# AAA My Work page
The "My Work" page displays three photos taken by the photographer, with a description that appears when the user hovers over them. Hovering over each item highlights it and causes it to move up slightly, revealing the description.


# AAA Contact page
The "Contact" page includes the photographer's email and phone number, social media icons that redirect users to his profiles, and a downloadable CV for those who want more information. A form with fields for name, email, and message has also been added, along with a "Send" button. If any of the fields are empty, they will be highlighted in red to prompt the user to fill them out. If the user types an invalid email or leaves the message field blank, those fields will also be highlighted in red. Once all fields are filled out, the user can submit the form, and a message will be displayed to confirm that it was sent successfully.

# AAA footer page

Lastly, a footer displays the name of the website creator.
